# MQTT Extender - "Hello IoT World" Tutorial - HTML Client 

<!-- START DESCRIPTION mqttextender-example-hello_iot_world-client-javascript -->

The **Hello IoT World Demo** is a simple real-time telemetry application based 
on MQTT Extender.

###

## Details
The **Hello IoT World Demo** uses the *MQTT Extender Web Client API* to show how
MQTT Extender can be used to send real-time telemetry data through the Web. In
this demo, the data is generated by a random feed simulator of the telemetry 
metrics of a car such as Speed and Engine RPM. The data is displayed through two
real-time gauges, one for speed and one for engine RPM.

Real-time data are delivered by a feed simulator running in Node.js

## Install
If you want to install a version of this demo pointing to your local MQTT
Extender, follows these steps.

* As prerequiste, this demo needs a MQTT infrastructure to run. You can choose 
whatever MQTT broker you prefer, or may also use one of the avaible public 
broker (an update-to-date list is maintaned at 
[https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers]()).
* Configure and launch a MQTT Extender instance. Please refer to Lightstreamer
web site [download page](http://download.lightstreamer.com/) to find the MQTT
Extender download package. MQTT Extender comes with a set of predefined 
configurations for connecting with local MQTT server instances, as well as with
the most common publicly accessible brokers. If you want to provide a new custom
configuration, open the `mqtt_master_connector_conf.xml` file located under
`<MQTTEXTENDER_HOME>/conf` and provide a set of entries similar to the following
(please refer to the inline documentation for more in-depth information on how
to configure broker connection parameters):
  ```xml
  ...
  <!-- MQTT broker connection parameters for a local instance 
  listening on port 1883, aliased by "mybroker". -->
  <param name="mybroker.server_address">tcp://localhost:1883</param>
  <param name="mybroker.connection_timeout">5</param>
  <param name="mybroker.keep_alive">20</param>
  ...
  ```  

* Download this project.
* RequireJS is currently hot-linked in the html page: you may want to replace it
with a local version and/or to upgrade its version.
* jQuery is currently hot-linked in the html page: you may want to replace it
with a local version and/or to upgrade its version.
* Deploy this demo on the MQTT Extender (used as Web server) or in any external
Web server. If you choose the former, create a folder with name such as
`HelloIoTWorld` under the `<MQTTEXTENDER_HOME>/pages`, and copy there the
contents of the `src` folder of this project.

## Configure
The demo assumes that MQTT Extender is launched from localhost, but if you need
to target a different server, search in `js/index.js` this line:
```js
MQTTExtender.connect('http://localhost:8080', {
``` 
and change it accordingly.

Further, the demo will look for the **mosquitto** alias, which is predefined in
the default MQTT Extender configuration. Once more, if you need to target a
different MQTT broker, and provided that relative connection parameters are
already defined as shown above, modify the following line in `js/index.js`:

```js
  mqttClient = mqttExtenderSession.createClient('mosquitto');
```
and change it by replacing **mosquitto** with new alias mapping the MQTT broker
you are going to use.

## Launch
Open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:8080/HelloIoTWorld](), or to
the address according to the host and/or the name of the folder where you
deployed the project.
